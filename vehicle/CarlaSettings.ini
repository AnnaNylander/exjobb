; client to connect.

; N+1 and N+2 respectively.

; In synchronous mode, CARLA waits every frame until the control from the client
; is received.
SynchronousMode=true
; Send info about every non-player agent in the scene every frame, the
; information is attached to the measurements message. This includes other
; vehicles, pedestrians and traffic signs. Disabled by default to improve
; performance.

[CARLA/Sensor]
; Names of the cameras to be attached to the player, comma-separated, each of
; them should be defined in its own subsection. E.g., Uncomment next line to add
; a camera called MyCamera to the vehicle

Sensors=CameraRGB,HDL32
; Post-processing effect to be applied. Valid values:
;   * None                  No effects applied.
;   * SceneFinal            Post-processing present at scene (bloom, fog, etc).
;   * Depth                 Depth map ground-truth only.
;   * SemanticSegmentation  Semantic segmentation ground-truth only.

; Now, every camera we added needs to be defined it in its own subsection.
